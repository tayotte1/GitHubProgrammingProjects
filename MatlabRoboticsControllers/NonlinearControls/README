These are examples of code I wrote for nonlinear systems.

Q6Main.m

This code will show an example of a closed loop controller for a nonlinear system.
There are two parts to it. One will avoid an obstacle the other will just go to a point.

To run my code please follow these instructions:
1. Open 'Q6Main.m'
2. Delete the "%\" from whichever section you want to run (ie Obstacle Avoidence)
3. Run and look at the plots that appear

The obstacle avoidance takes about a minute to run on my machine but your machine is probably better than mine.


Question4.m
This code will show an example of trajectory generation for a differentially flat nonlinear system

To run:
1. Make sure car_flat_car.m is in your directory
2. Run and look at the graphs that appear



car_chained_test.m

This code shows and example of a chained form trajectory generation
Just run the code and a graph should appear showing the generated trajectory.
