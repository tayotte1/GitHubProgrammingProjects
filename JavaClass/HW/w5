There will be 4 methods outside of main.

Method courseNumber will generate the random course number (ex. 110.320).
- Department numbers must range from 010 to 650 (inclusive at both ends), and all must
  be multiples of ten.
- Course numbers can range from 101 to 510 and 601 to 810, inclusive at all ends.

Method designator will generate the random designators (ex. HSE).
- The area designators can be any combination of HSNQEW, regardless of department
  codes. For each course, each designator might be assigned with a 50% probability.

Method credits will generate the random number of credits for the course (ex. 3).
- Credits must be a multiple of .5 and range from 1 to 4.5 inclusive at both ends.
- Half the time the credits should be a 3, 15% of the time they should be a 4, 10%
  of the time they should be a 1, and the remaining 25% distribution should be 
  equally divided among the other valid values.
  
Method course will generate the full line of text for the course (ex. 110.320 3 HSE).
- It will call all the other methods and combine them into one line of text to print.
